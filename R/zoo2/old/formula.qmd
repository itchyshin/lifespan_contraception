title: "Meta-analysis: summarizing causes of death"

To summarize these differences across studies, we calculated the risk difference (RD) between treatment (castrated or contraceptive) and control groups using the formula:

$$
RD = p_t - p_c
$$

where $p_t$ is the proportion of deaths from a specific cause in the treatment group and $p_c$ is the proportion of deaths from the same cause in the control group.

The sampling variance ($V_{RD}$) of the risk difference was calculated as follows:

$$
V_{RD} = \frac{p_t(1 - p_t)}{n_t} + \frac{p_c(1 - p_c)}{n_c}
$$

where $n_t$ and $n_c$ are the total number of individuals in the treatment and control groups, respectivel.
